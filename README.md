# INF224_telecom
The work for design paradigme (https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/elc/cpp/TP-C++.html)

## C++
The major multimedia management system (photo, video, film, group of multimedia) along with a tcp client server implementation (in the folder tcpserver).

## media
Some multimedia demo for test.

## Swing
The implementation of java GUI for client. Attention, the key part is the RemoteSwing folder in which we define a MyFrame.java GUI to send requests to c++ server. (The Swing/src folder only contains some demos of the java Swing.)
